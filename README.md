## Background

The restrictions put in place to limit the diffusion and impacts of Covid-19 have had a widespread impact on people’s lives, and the way energy is used across entire economies.

One of the biggest impacts has been the reduction in passenger transport demand, due to a combination of government lockdowns and fears of contracting and spreading the virus when using mass transport modes. Therefore, a key question for the energy sector is whether changes to transport behaviours during the crisis may result in a permanent change in behaviour (and transport energy use) or if transport patterns will revert to ‘business as usual’ when the crisis ends. 


## Objectives

- Determine what factors may contribute to the change in bike path usage
- Determine the significance of each factor, especially COVID-19, in changing the bike path usage in Madison
- Develop a model to predict bicycle path usage in the near future
